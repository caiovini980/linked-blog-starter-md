- Search how to write a good documentation for a feature
	- Show the problem
	- Present a possible solution
		- Follow the flux of the information and, on each method explicit the parameters used, what that method does and what should it return
	- On the GitHub page, show some really technical stuff on the README file (it's GitHub, not itch.io anyways) and ALWAYS make the project just a one click build. Use a 'make' file to handle dependencies (download all vendors from machine) and make it as simple as possible to run on the interviewer machine.
