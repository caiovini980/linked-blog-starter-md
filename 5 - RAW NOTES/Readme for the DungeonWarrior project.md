# Dungeon Warrior Game Project

## A game project written with the purpose of applying theorical knowledge into practical using C++.

This game was originally created to experiment C++ with SDL, but it became more like a learning platform about how could I approach working with:

* Use external libraries on a C++ project
* Implement design patterns commonly used in game development
* Create make files to help with the project build for any platform, here is used [Premake](https://premake.github.io/)
- Use some newer features of C++ such as smart pointers
- Write a decent README

## Current result
